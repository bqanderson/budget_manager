# Focus Budget Manager (Vue.js exercise)

  This is my first attempt at using [Vue.js][vue-page]. I will be following along with a tutorial from [CodeBurst][codeburst] written by Gustavo Domaradzki. Part One of Four can be found [here][bm-tutorial]. Or you can find the GitHub repo [here][bm-github].

## Objectives

  * To work with and learn more about [Vue.js][vue-page].
  * Strengthen my skills as a JavaScript developer.
  * Inspire future project.

  * New tools, frameworks, and concepts that I will also be using:
    * JWT Authorization with Passport.js
    * API methods
    * Consign (NPM- script autoloader)
    * CORS (NPM- Connect/Express middleware)
    * Bcrypt (NPM- salt & hash generator)
    * Morgan (NPM- HTTP request logger)
    * Module Alias (NPM- Create aliases & register custom module paths)

  * Tools, frameworks, and concepts that I will improve upon:
    * Node.js
    * express.js
    * MongoDB
    * NPM
    * Git

## Ongoing Thoughts and Observations

  * Building in Node.js still feels very similar. I am remembering things quite well as I go.
  * Module Alias is awesome. Great little NPM package to keep code nice and clean. It kind of reminds me of Sass, create a variable in one file to keep your code DRY and concise.
  * The directory setup on this is a bit different than I'm use to in Nod.js projects. Not sure if that's a [Vue.js][vue-page] thing, or part of this [tutorial][bm-tutorial].
